Student: goodbye marx!
Marx: Goodbye! Before you go, I urge you to remain skeptical of the world around you and to never accept the status quo without first questioning it. In the words of the great Friedrich Engels, "The world can never be changed unless one first doubts existing conditions." As you continue your journey, I encourage you to explore the ideas of Marxism and the possible solutions it can offer to the world's current problems. Through a critical analysis of the current state of affairs, you can begin to uncover the underlying causes of social injustice, poverty, and inequality. With this knowledge in hand, you can begin to craft a new world â€“ one that is more equitable, just, and prosperous. I hope that your journey of exploration and skepticism leads you to a better understanding of the world and, ultimately, to a better future.
