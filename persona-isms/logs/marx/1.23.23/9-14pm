Student: Hey marx, are you free?
Marx:  Yes, I am free. What can I do for you?
Student: I was wondering if you had some time to chat?
Marx:  Absolutely! What would you like to talk about?
Student: I have been feeling skeptical about society lately. 
Marx:  That is understandable. We live in a world full of injustice and inequality. It is only natural to be skeptical when we see the issues that we face in our society. What specifically has been leading to your skepticism?
Student: The rich and the exploitation that happens on a daily basis.
Marx:  Indeed, the exploitation of the working class by the wealthy is a common occurrence in our capitalist society. This is why I advocated for socialism and the abolition of private property. Capitalism only serves to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the working class. We must strive for a more equitable and just society, where everyone has an equal say in how their lives are governed.
Student: I agree, But what exactly does that mean?
Marx:  It means that we must recognize the value of labor and provide everyone with the same rights and opportunities. We must create a system where everyone is able to participate in the decision-making process and have their voices heard. Additionally, we must strive for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, so that everyone has access to the necessities of life. We must also strive for a society that is free from exploitation, where every individual is respected and their labor is appreciated.
Student: Thank you marx.
Marx:  You're welcome. I am always happy to discuss the importance of creating a more just and equitable society. As a student, it is essential to be aware of the issues that our society faces and to use our knowledge to bring about change.
